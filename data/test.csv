Conservative@Government charity extinguishes the productive incentives and motivations to improve oneself and achieve ones own wealth and standing in society .
Conservative@The case for freeing markets is that such freedom best enables individuals to find ways to use their knowledge and skills to create value for others and thereby create wealth for themselves .
Conservative@Drawing parallels to justified killings of self-defense , Napolitano writes , `` The intentional killing of a baby , for example , can never be right ; a baby is the embodiment of innocence and is in no position to have his or her right to life stripped .
Conservative@The New York Times columnist David Brooks boasts of being a `` progressive , national greatness '' conservative , an orientation that seems indistinguishable from a `` Great Society '' liberal ( even if Brooks is willing to criticize the harmful `` unintended consequences '' of LBJ 's welfare state ) .
Conservative@That growth , argues sociologist Milmon F. Harrison in Righteous Riches : The Word of Faith Movement in Contemporary African American Religion , is attributable to Reaganite economic policies , the increasing divide between rich and poor , and the gap between the reality of people 's economic lives and the prosperity depicted on popular television shows and in movies .
Conservative@`` Cities are either jubilant that they 've been designated high-risk targets for terrorism , because that means more dollars , more jobs , more shiny riot gear ... or else they 're resentful that they 're lower-risk targets , because there 's fewer ( dollars ) in it for them , '' wrote Pierre Tristam of the Daytona Beach News-Journal .
Conservative@Just thank your lucky stars that even such a hopelessly socially challenged species such as yourselves can still benefit from a productive division of labor , thanks to the miracle of the market system .
Conservative@On the strength of this argument , and given the increasingly high cost of clinical trials , Epstein concludes that the FDA puts an unnecessary burden on the industry when it requires that manufacturers conduct clinical trials to demonstrate the superiority of a drug candidate over a placebo .
Conservative@Every discussion of the causes of the cutbacks in education , within any government school forum , has been overwhelmingly one-sided , with teachers blaming everyone who favors limited government .
Conservative@To this callous `` let them eat cake '' sentiment , true racial progressives must fashion a pragmatic response , one that turns the temperature down , allows white America to save face ... and allows whites to benefit .
Conservative@As with the argument above , the idea that future generations will be poisoned by our waste unless we carry out curbside recycling programs is ridiculous .
Conservative@The fact that the gun makes lethal force easier works solely in favor of the weaker defender , not the stronger attacker .
Conservative@The ATF , based on DEA wiretap intercepts , had sufficient probable cause to make arrests as early as 2009 , or at least to use other investigative techniques to disrupt the purchases and seize the weapons .
Conservative@For example , until we actually produce more of our electricity from sources other than fossil fuels , it does not measurably change the environment for some states and the federal government to force all of us to subsidize plug-in electric cars by giving tax credits for them .
Conservative@All that our modern reporters-as ignorant of such matters as it is possible to be-could do was to fall back on the modern prejudice that tradition is something to be despised because it 's backward and novelty embraced because it 's more enlightened .
Conservative@A report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission notes that China 's acquisition of the cruiser , should that occur , `` would present a significant threat to the U.S. and its allie ( d ) Asian navies , in addition to the possibility of using its missiles to attack land targets .
Conservative@The problem was that , unless other central banks , especially the Federal Reserve , agreed to inflate in tandem with the Bank of England , the pound would lose value relative to other currencies ( especially the comparatively strongly backed U.S. dollar ) , and Britain 's reserves of precious metals would flow overseas .
Conservative@Bad farm policy and bad trade agreements are killing small towns , and small towns and small businesses are the heart of this nation . ''
Conservative@This is because the jobs created by the forcible redirection of capital always come at the expense of other , more efficient jobs that the private sector would have created somewhere else .
Conservative@He impugned liberalism as frankly elitist and impulsively hostile to `` the positive features of petty-bourgeois culture : its moral realism , its understanding that everything has its price , its respect for limits , its skepticism about progress .
Conservative@But herein lies their potential soft spot : Millennials can too easily be swayed by slick-sellers of tolerance and compassion , because jumping off the bandwagon of bigotry is their allegiance and generational calling card .
Conservative@Freedom does not create perfect solutions , but there is abundant evidence that choices and competition improve the quality of life for almost everyone .
Conservative@That arrangement necessarily makes the patient and the doctor less concerned with using dollars efficiently for legitimate treatments and less interested in stopping fraud and abuse that may even be occurring in their name .
Conservative@The idea that government can benevolently pick the right winners and punish the bad actors is utterly contrary to our sense of justice and common sense .
Conservative@As difficult as the work may seem , I believe we have an obligation to engage in efforts to bring about peace in the Middle East , not only for the benefit of the people of the region , but for the safety and security of our own children as well .

Conservative@Climate scientists rush in overwhelming numbers to repel infection by ideas not supportive of the basic thesis that global warming is perhaps the greatest of the threats to mankind and that it is caused by human folly -- the burning of fossil fuels to support our way of life .
Conservative@But it was wrong primarily because it undermined the natural basis of sex as exclusively a means to produce babies , not because it was always deemed the taking of human life .

Conservative@Romney supported the TARP bank bailout in 2008 , a bailout that sparked the Tea Party movement 's ire at the use of taxpayers ' money to bail out a few super-rich banks that lost risky gambles on a real estate market bubble .
Conservative@Abstract : In order to provide an advantage for Chinese industries and companies , and to attract U.S. companies to locate in its country , the Beijing government manipulates its currency , showers subsidies on favored industries , provides low-interest loans from a state-owned banking system , tolerates and even encourages the theft of intellectual property , and ignores WTO rules .
Conservative@( His ) abdication of his Christian responsibility to share the Gospel with all non-Christians , his refusal to mention Jesus to Jews , has cost him a few Christian Zionist and Messianic friends but it 's secured him the respect and trust of Likud politicians as well as more radical right-wingers , '' she explains .

Conservative@Topping them all , at last in terms of rhetorical panache , is Mark Anthony Neal or , as he frequently refers to himself , the `` Thug-Nigga-Intellectual '' - a `` dangerous nigger and America has never romanticized about its fear of angry ` do n't give a f -- k ' niggers .
Conservative@But arguing from the lesser to the greater , if even children detect and justifiably resent hypocrisy , tens of millions of grown adults are nothing short of outraged when they see it in their elected leaders .
Conservative@These personal dimensions of busts are used to justify government intervention , whether creating a safety net or drawing up regulations aimed at smoothing out the cycle supposedly inherent in the free market .
Conservative@In this same spirit , the Treasury 's plan for `` protecting consumers and investors '' means `` making more regulations to relieve consumers and investors of the responsibility of making informed choices and accepting the consequences of risk .
Conservative@For instance , the Motion Picture Code ensured that scripts upheld the value of human life , that sin and wrongdoing were not justified , that brutality , indecent exposure , and sexual relationships would not violate standards of common decency .

Conservative@Some business leaders argue that American employees are simply anti-union , a consequence of our culture 's strong individualistic ethic and opposition to unions as uninvited `` third parties '' between employers and their employees .
Conservative@Because logic and facts are not on their side , they instead try to enflame emotion to evoke fear and guilt in their feeble attempt to recruit intellectually weak adherents to their classic `` feel good '' cause .
Conservative@Herring and her friends had help and guidance from Americans United for Life , a nonprofit law firm in Chicago that has pushed to end abortion through an `` incremental '' approach-as opposed to a `` frontal assault '' championed by other groups-ever since the Supreme Court legalized the procedure in 1973 .
Conservative@There was nothing in the Constitution to allow for creation of a national bank , and certainly no authorization for Congress to create a monster such as the Federal Reserve .
Conservative@The only trouble is , right now there are too few people working on these clever schemes ; because the industry has stag-nated for so long , nuclear energy does n't tend to attract as much research interest these days .
Conservative@But Kerry never developed a compelling argument about the economy and how he would fight for working people .
Conservative@And just to be sure that they are utterly delighted , Mansfield smears all over the top of his dish a thick layer of sneers and jibes , rather like anchovy paste , delicious to some but revolting to others -- patronizing characterizations of women as harboring a `` secret liking for housework , '' or enjoying `` the pleasurable duty of henpecking .
Conservative@While there certainly may be a number of factors contributing to America 's success and great wealth , one tradition and idea secured by the Constitution towers above the rest : freedom .

Conservative@( The original data had been conveniently discarded for `` lack of storage space '' ) Alarmists had also trivialized urban heat island effects and ignored the elimination of low-temperature reporting stations from global temperature records .
Conservative@Strict gun-control laws , including banning guns , will likely lead to an increase in murders and other violent crime here because our present high murder rate is a reflection of our culture , not guns , and because the law-abiding would then be largely disarmed .
Conservative@It should be no surprise that threats to family life and threats to free enterprise are interrelated .
Conservative@As reported in THE NEW AMERICAN , the FFA was written to exempt guns that were manufactured in-state for use in-state from federal gun-control laws because they are not within the parameters of `` interstate commerce , '' since the Interstate Commerce Clause is used as the rationale for empowering the federal government to control guns in states .
Conservative@The distinction here is important : freedom requires that government not force religious doctrine or morality onto the people , but it must allow the free operation of religion , freedom of association , and the practice of religious-based values throughout society .
Conservative@Here , Associate Director Tweeny outlines the office 's objectives , which include 1 ) `` allocating resources to areas that are producing the outcomes we value '' ( read : `` let 's jump on the ` diversity ' bandwagon '' ) ; 2 ) `` satisfy the requirements of accrediting agencies and funding agencies '' ( read : `` make connections with gurus like Shakti Butler '' ) ; 3 ) `` strengthen arguments for increased funding .

Conservative@For instance , the Federal Reserve responded to the 1991 recession with low interest rates and the ready availability of credit , helping to create the tech bubble , a phenomenal increase in the price of technology stocks accompanied by heavy investment in the sector .
Conservative@This includes , to quote the Oregon bill as introduced , having `` each state agency ... maintain a copy of each monthly statement for all its credit cards '' used by employees and requiring each month 's statement to be made available on the Internet within 30 days after it was paid , with only the credit-card number deleted .
Conservative@As quick as he is to lay blame at BP 's door , Obama is apparently less eager to own up to the role that blatantly unconstitutional federal regulations have played in making a bad situation exponentially worse .
Conservative@International economic forces are limiting wages for most U.S. workers , increasing income inequality , and heightening pressure on the World War II-era system of benefits provided through the private sector .
Conservative@Interventions can lead to destructive , unintended consequences that cause real suffering for real people , many of them deceived by government-distorted signals .
Conservative@Until , that is , the price of conventional energy skyrocketed , wars over oil proliferated , smaller entrepreneurs swung into action , inventors started expanding solar efficiency , and the government finally started to help , freeing up tax credits and research grants for solar development .
Conservative@( Of course , Obama does n't explain that the 14,000 `` losing their health insurance '' are mainly victims of other government malfeasance that has cratered the economy , such as job losses caused by government-subsidized immigrant workers and U.S. regulatory compliance costs that in 2006 were 31.7 percent higher than those of our nine largest trading partners .
Conservative@Liberals often attribute that success to conservatives ' effective attacks on `` big government '' and struggle valiantly to defend government from this assault - which will always be challenging given Americans ' ideological predisposition to favor `` small government .
Conservative@Creating a synergy between making money and helping others-the Puritan Protestant formula for entrepreneurial virtue-producers profited by making commodities for the workers they employed , a circle of virtue that benefited both classes and society at large .
Conservative@While tea party leaders agree on broad principles such as limited government , lower taxes , and individual liberty , they address different issues in different areas .

Conservative@In one he calls Islam `` a hostile and aggressive religion , '' and goes on to lament a `` widespread loss of the Christian moral vision , '' most evident in Europe , where `` birth rates far below replacement levels have already allowed millions of Muslims from North Africa and the Middle East to ... heavily influence the political agenda .
Conservative@Tocqueville explained , however , that the danger threatening yet motivating most societies is the miscomprehension of equality , resulting in their descent into centralized tyranny .

Conservative@He worked to block a bill -- virtually identical to the federal law he now claims to support -- in the Illinois legislature that would have made it illegal to kill or deny care to children born alive in failed abortion procedures .
Conservative@As this contrast suggests , the difficulties facing the young generally-both children and young adults-are the result of long-standing limitations in social policy whose effects have been aggravated by recent changes in the economy and the family .
Conservative@From the foregoing it should be apparent that it is not free-enterprise capitalism that is evil , but , rather , it is the people who abuse such an economic system who are evil .
Conservative@The Term Securities Lending Facility , created in March 2008 , made hundreds of billions of new dollars ' worth of Treasury securities available to primary dealers against a wider range of collateral and for longer time intervals than had previously been the case .
Conservative@To moderate the pain of paying high gas prices , the Obama administration plans to confiscate a `` reasonable share '' ( you might guess who is to determine what is `` reasonable '' ) of record-breaking `` windfall profits '' of the oil companies and give it to American families as an `` emergency energy rebate .
Conservative@Using more embryos boosts the success rate but also results in multiple births , which are far riskier for the woman and often lead to premature delivery and dire health problems in the infants .
Conservative@When work becomes illegal , employers have a big weapon to use against any effort to organize unions or fight for better conditions .
Conservative@Moreover , as pointed out by Hans Bader of the Competitive Enterprise Institute , `` Government meddling , along with federal regulatory pressure on lenders to promote ` affordable housing ' and ` diversity , ' helped erode traditional lending standards , resulting in more risky mortgage loans to irresponsible people with bad credit ( as some longtime supporters of federal meddling now admit ) .
Conservative@liberty , personal sovereignty , individual rights , human dignity , and the opportunity to pursue happiness are given to us by God because that is the only basis that can guarantee those blessings for everyone .
Conservative@Perhaps the best opportunity to create such a system came in the late 1940s , when Harry Truman attempted to create a system that would have looked essentially like Medicare for the whole population .
Conservative@One reason I think I won this election was I could bridge the gap with common issues that Tea Party folk and liberty folk in the district had in common ; every ( Michigan ) Tea Party group supported me .
Conservative@While cyber-crimes could pose a devastating threat to American businesses , critics are questioning the freedom-related implications of government action , as regulations and government-private sector alliances could impede civil liberties .
Conservative@As we remain engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan , as conditions in Yemen , Bahrain , and Pakistan become more precarious by the day , and as Iran races to develop nuclear weapons , one might be tempted to conclude President Obama lacks any comprehensive strategy for addressing radical Islamism and other threats facing the United States .
Conservative@During the 1920s , Great Britain , terrified of having to face depreciation of the pound as a result of running the printing presses , pressured the United States and other powers to inflate in concert with the Bank of England , leading to another global inflationary cycle and economic bubble that burst in 1929 with the great stock market crash .
Conservative@His aim can not possibly be to strengthen our military , because it would do just the opposite : create unnecessary tensions , divisions , and stress among men and women who must depend on one another in order to survive .
Conservative@It would relieve the pressure on U.S. automakers to bankroll the rising costs of legacy health insurance-an expense that does n't burden their foreign competitors-and , in exchange , obligate them to invest heavily in energy-efficiency technologies and comply with substantially more aggressive fuel-economy standards .
Conservative@The constant expansion in gun ownership ( with the number of new firearms entering American possession averaging around 4 million a year ) and expanded rights to legally carry weapons have been accompanied by a 41 percent decline in violent crime rates over the past two decades .
Conservative@Although the environmentalists lose the argument on the economics of curbside recycling , their support for such recycling programs relies on a host of other arguments that initially appear to be at least somewhat convincing .
Conservative@The 9\/11 attacks showed what just a few determined terrorists can do when we allow them easy access to our country , and here we are letting millions of people come in unchecked .
Conservative@Conveniently , last year 's Kelo v. City of New London Supreme Court decision provides the necessary justification to transfer the property of one private citizen to another who would make better use of it -- for the Super Highway is to be constructed and operated by public\/private partnerships that smack of fascism .
Conservative@Rather than cultivating a moral society and individual virtuousness , whether through faith , education , or sociability , and building on the accumulated experience and wisdom of earlier generations , utopianism breeds dishonesty not good character ; it encourages ideology not reason ; it rewards rashness not reflection ; it attracts fanatics not statesmen ; and it is transformative not reformative .
Conservative@This helps explain why there are so many in government today who think that regulations are no big deal , that taxes can go up with no consequence , that inflation is harmless , that the minimum wage -- and the regular increases in the minimum wage -- surely causes no harm .
Conservative@As minority voters continue in greater numbers to climb the economic ladder , the Republican Party has a golden opportunity to speak with them about how our policies to stimulate economic growth will benefit all those who want to succeed .

Conservative@As I mentioned before , it also strengthens the power of greedy bastards in America to lower US wages .
Conservative@The idea was that the president needed complete control over the executive branch ; therefore , he needed the power to fire executive officials -- including the independent counsel and the heads of independent agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission -- who did n't share his vision .
Conservative@A `` crisis '' developed recently when the value of those privately held shares dropped drastically ( in large part because government interventions in the housing market had helped create a bubble that eventually sprang a leak ) .

Conservative@The only thing artificial anywhere near the Tea Party protests were the counterprotests Obama staged , sending in his SEIU thugs to shout down , bully , intimidate , and physically attack the Tea Party patriots .

Conservative@They should be forced to render an opinion on the dangerous Law of the Sea Treaty , the harm created by federal funding of and federal presence in the nation 's schools , and the abomination involved in forcing taxpayers to fund abortion providers .
Conservative@Progressives will also have to confront an inconvenient truth : They are losing on economic issues not because Americans ' judgments are clouded by social issues or racial animosity but because , battered by the economic trends just described and bombarded with mixed messages , many middle-class Americans are wondering whether progressives can really deliver a better economic life .
Conservative@The trillions of dollars required to keep promises made by Medicare and Social Security in the coming decades make stimulus outlays look like pocket change .
Conservative@Once Americans saw the gulf between his reasonable , optimistic campaign promises and his radical presidency , they rallied against him at tea parties , denounced his policies at townhall meetings , and finally , severely punished his party at the ballot box .
Conservative@As outrageous and repugnant as UN control over sites like Independence Hall is , the UN has managed to create other programs that represent very credible threats to the freedom of every American .
Conservative@Commenting on the antics of our ruling class , both foreign and domestic , over the past century , the authors write : `` It was as if the United States wanted to destroy itself -- first by bankrupting its economy , and second by creating enemies all over the globe .
Conservative@Since there is no objective basis for determining the proper place to stop on the continuum of positive moral action intensity ( people can honestly disagree about how generous is generous enough , for example ) , moral exhortations are inherently subjective .
Conservative@The federal government would need to create a vast IRS-type bureaucracy to set allowance levels and process permits , collect data , monitor and audit compliance , investigate alleged violations , and ultimately enforce emission standards and levels through penalties , fines , and litigation .
Conservative@Or maybe you just knew , without anyone needing to point out the obvious , that creating trillions in money and credit out of thin air to pay for bailouts and unfunded government promises was a really bad idea .
Conservative@We need as well to make changes to our tax code that boost domestic manufacturing and reward corporations for creatingjobs in the U.S. Congress should reduce corporate income taxes and move to a value-added tax on imports .
Conservative@Had an equally prominent conservative columnist written the same thing about a large group of Democrats , he would have been forced to resign , given how intense the attacks by Jewish defense organizations and liberal media would have been .
Conservative@Wilcox , Professor Carol Swain , and other researchers have pointed out that the SPLC 's practice of exaggerating the `` extremist '' and `` hate group '' threat actually helps draw recruits to the groups they claim to be fighting .

Conservative@On balance , Schumpeter believed that assuming creation led to destruction , in that order , capitalism was a better economic system than the alternatives .
Conservative@As we have just seen , because the Modern Liberal feels he must protect the evil , failed , and wrong , he simply has no choice but to do so by attacking the good , right , and successful .
Conservative@Again , the parts of speech tell all : The personal `` my '' ( `` my Medicare '' ) reveals the closeness these speakers feel toward the service the government provides , while the impersonal `` the '' ( `` the government '' ) evinces how distant , disconnected , and distrustful they feel toward the source ofthat treasured service .

Conservative@All initiative , creativity , entrepreneurship , productivity , faith , love , and charity begin at the individual level .

Conservative@When ` musicians ' such as rappers get rich promoting misogyny , crime and disrespect , and ... when we effectively encourage moral decay with social policies that encourage rather than discourage strong nuclear families ; stories like this one are an inevitable result .

Conservative@Union shop proponents point out that the `` free rider '' option weakens labor unions because fewer people are likely to join a labor union and pay membership dues if they can opt out and still enjoy the benefits of membership .
Conservative@The Obama administration , together with assorted `` neo-leftist supporters , '' is attempting to use the state capitalist cards of imperialism abroad , massive deficit spending , giveaways to finance capital , and cuts in working class `` entitlements '' such as wages and retirement benefits to stop the potential collapse of capitalism and create a renewal of accumulation under conditions that serve overall capitalist interests .

Conservative@As far back as the 1930s , Hayek made a name for himself by arguing that socialist economies , even ones that provided wide scope for market interactions as well as government planning , were doomed to fail .
Conservative@His son , ophthalmologist Rand Paul , has led the liberty fight in the U.S. Senate as Kentucky 's junior Senator and was a founder of the Senate Tea Party caucus .
